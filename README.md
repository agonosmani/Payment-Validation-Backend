# Payment-Validation-Backend

<h4>A step by step guide on how to run the back-end part of the application: </h4>

<p>We can start by cloning the back-end project into a local directory.</p>

<p>We open our IDE and select open project. We select the pom.xml file inside the folder, instead of the whole project and we click open. We will be prompted with a message box, in which we click Open as project and then Trust Project. </p>

<p>Then we navigate to the file 
  `src/main/java/mk/com/gigavoice/payment/PaymentApplication.java`.
  After we run that file, the project starts running successfully.</p>
